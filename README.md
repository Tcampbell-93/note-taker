# Note-taker

## Description
In this project I created the backend of a note taker app. I was given all the front end code and had to create the routes to the db file. This project was challenging to try to match backend programing to given front end programming. I learned a lot about how to set up different kinds of routes such as get, post, and delete.

## Installation 
In order to use this application you need to install express and uuid. 

## Usage
This app will direct you to a landing page, from there click the button 'Get Started'. This will bring you to the main page where you can enter notes on the right hand side. Once you click save they will appear on the left hand side. You can click on the previously saved notes on the left and edit them. You can also click the red button on the notes to delete the saved notes.
